# Auto Assign Review Teams

- Assign individual persons or member of [GitHub Teams](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams)
- Team Assignment Works best, if [code review assignment](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team) for the team is enabled
- Assign individual person from list of persons or first Github Team in the list if `pick-one-from-persons-or-team` flag is true
